It ranges from 0 to 10.Each member a faction gains brings a change to it's power. The increase of power will be calculated on a base value. like 50 (called base-member-constant in power raid config section). Then, this base value will get multiplied by a factor of 1 over the current member amount.Example Log:FactionMax Power: 10; 1 Member New Member: 10 + 50 * 1 / 1 (last member count) = 60 New Member: 60 + 50 * 1 / 2 = 85 New Member: 85 + 50 * 1 / 3 = 102 (When adding, ceil) Left Member: 102- 50 * 1 / 3 (member count - 1) = 85 (When subtracting, floor) Why?This tries to help smaller factions. When for example the third member joined, it gained the faction 17 max power, while when the 20th member would have joined, it would have gained the faction only 3 max power. This drop-off can be configured. Each online member accumulates the their full power potential. Additionally, to motivate factions to play at the same time, there will be a boost at the power accumulation based on the amount of people that have taken part in the accumulation. All members counted as inactive (Last seen 7 days or so) will have a negative effect on this accumulation. This is forgiving for players that just can't login daily, but will still punish alts / inactive players. Claiming a chunk costs a faction power. The more chunks a faction owns, the more expensive the chunks get, controlled by a constant in the config. This should help factions value their chunks if the max chunks is set to a very high number. When a faction accumulates power, their allies will receive a small fraction of it. This will help control the amount of allies being formed. Too many allies and you won't have any power left for yourself. Not the right allies / not enough and you'll have major disadvantages in combat. Accumulation The accumulation formula is quite complex, but its purpose is to balance the power accumulation in a faction-based game. Here's a breakdown of how it works and why it's designed this way: The formular:base + max(((1 + activeMembers / totalMembers)^accumulation-active-exponent - inactiveMembers * accumulation-inactive-multiplier) * accumulation-multiplier, 0) Purpose:The formula aims to create a fair system for factions of different sizes, especially favoring smaller factions. It encourages factions to have more active members while penalizing inactive ones. Formula Explanation:The formula has several components: Active Member Normalization: Active members are normalized between 1 and 2. This means that a small faction with a few active members can achieve a similar accumulation rate as a larger faction, promoting fairness. For example, a faction with 1 online member and 2 total members would accumulate 1.5, while a faction with 50 members and only 1 active member would accumulate only 1.02. Penalty for Inactive Members: Inactive members are penalized without normalization. This means that if, for instance, 10% of a faction's members are inactive, there will be a penalty of 1 for a faction of 10 members and the same penalty for a faction of 100 members. This encourages factions to keep their members active. Zero Accumulation Floor: The formula ensures that the accumulated power won't drop below zero. This prevents factions from facing catastrophic losses in power. In summary, this complex formula is designed to level the playing field among factions of varying sizes, motivating them to have more active members while discouraging inactivity. It fosters fairness and competition in the game environment. Overclaiming &amp; Raiding Claims will get unprotected when a faction can't afford the base claim power cost. This means when they have more claims then they have power. The chunk will be raidable by everyone. Once a chunk is no longer protected, factions that are in war with this faction can start the overclaiming process. Overclaiming will work by having someone of a faction you're in war with stay in your chunk for x time units. This makes sure that the enemy faction has to &quot;capture&quot; the claim before overclaiming it. This also prevents them from overclaiming in such a short time, that the other faction had no chance to defend their property. Allies can offer help by sending power. This is just a idea I had right now, but maybe that gives allies another purpose to exist","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Placeholders","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/ImprovedFactions/docs/placeholders","content":"Placeholders This file contains all placeholders that are available in ImprovedFactions.

Solution:  The owner is stored as a UUID, not a BLOB. The issue lies in how the OR mapper handles storage across different databases.On SQLite, it stores the UUID as var(36), while MySQL stores it as a BINARY(16) for efficiency.To retrieve the UUID in a readable format, use SELECT HEX(owner) AS owner FROM table_name;.After converting the UUID to a string, use the Mojang API to get the player's name and other details.  Key takeaway: For databases like MySQL that store UUIDs as BINARY(16), use HEX() to convert them back to a readable format and then fetch player information via the Mojang API.

Disabling Overclaiming and RaidingProblem: User wanted to disable all overclaiming and raiding while keeping chunk claiming. Solution: Disabling the power system will turn off raids and claiming limits. However, once disabled, there is no max claim limit.Alternatively, by disabling claim costs and player death penalties, claims can become unraidable. Key takeaway: Disabling the power system removes overclaiming and raiding but also disables claim limits.    Max Claim Limit without Power SystemProblem: User wanted to set a max claim limit when the power system is disabled. Solution: There's no way to set a claim limit if the power system is turned off. Claims will be unlimited. Key takeaway: No max claim limit exists if the power system is disabled.    Blacklisting a World from ClaimsProblem: User wanted to blacklist a specific world from being claimed. Solution: The correct syntax is: blacklisted-worlds: - twilightforest Key takeaway: Use the folder name of the world in the config to blacklist it.    Economy-Based Power for FactionsProblem: User wanted to know if power could be bought with in-game currency. Solution: Not natively supported, but users can use external plugins to add power with the command/factions power add &lt;powertype&gt; &lt;power&gt; &lt;faction&gt;. Key takeaway: Power can be added via external plugins and commands but is not natively tied to an economy.

Key takeaway: Placeholder issues with PAPI will be resolved in future updates; parsing errors may exist in certain builds.    War Mechanics Between FactionsProblem: User wanted to know if the plugin supports war mechanics between enemy factions. Solution: The plugin does not currently support declaring war. A siege occurs when a faction loses power and others can claim their land. Key takeaway: There is no formal war declaration yet, but sieges happen when factions lose power.    Changing Plugin Language to SpanishProblem: User wanted to change the plugin language to Spanish but encountered issues. Solution: The .lang files are outdated for version 2.x.x. To add Spanish, create a new file in the language folder with the correct language code. The plugin will use the player‚Äôs game language settings to show translated messages. Key takeaway: For version 2.x.x, create a new language file, and the plugin will adjust based on players' language settings.    Language File IssuesProblem: User added the Spanish language file but saw some messages were not translated.
